# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends


Out of a total of 912 theater campaigns in the US, 58% of them have been successful while 38% have failed. We can approach this cautiously optimistic that the parent category trend tips towards a positive result.

Still looking at the theater category in the US we can give an estimate on which month in the year may have the highest rate of success. In the past, May had the largest number of successful plays and also the highest percent (68%). It should be noted that January, June, July and October all had about the same number of failed campaigns launched.

This trend is similar to the theater trend overall, which hits its highest success in June and then steadily decreased throughout the end of the year.

Another interesting find regarding the how the different parent categories under theater did in Great Britain, was that plays had the highest total number of campaigns and the most successful campaigns.

Foresight was a play that Louise mentioned she enjoyed in GB. Looking at that play specifically, we can see that it was successful in achieving its $2,000 goal and that it ran from a short time frame, from the end of April to mid May, which is around the time most plays are successful. Another takeaway from Foresight was that there were only 17 backers and that the average donation was about $118.  

The other specific plays that were brought up were Be Prepared, Checkpoint 22, Cutting Off Kate Bush, Jestia and Raedon, and Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Family. All five plays exceeded their goals, but most of the goals were in the $1,000-$2,000 range with only Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Family at $4,000.  The average donation was between $33-$52 and the number of backers ranged from 26 for the lowest goal campaign to 113 for the highest goal campaign.

Looking through the data, there were some worrisome information that Louise should definitely be aware of. Louise currently has a goal of over twice the average successful Kickstarter campaign which means she may want to adjust her goal or make sure she is able to secure high amount donations or backers.  One thing to note about Kickstarter strategy is that the mean and median pledged for failed campaigns were much lower than successful ones which could allude that failed campaigns are not due to backers being asked for too much money, there are other factors that are determining if a theater campaign is successful or not.

A deeper dive into the US Theater Statistics helps us determine that since the Standard Deviation Goal is over twice the IQR goal, there must be some outliers of failed campaigns with really high goals that are causing this substantial difference. 
Louise also mentioned that she’s interested in Great Britain for a future musical project with an estimated budge of £4,000.  After comparing the average Great Britain goal of £4,000 and the average pledged of £2,000, it is safe to assume that the £4,000 is pretty high and although there are some outliers that is skewing the distribution, it would be safer to have a smaller goal, especially considering that ¼ of campaigns are receiving no funding at all.
